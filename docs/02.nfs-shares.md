# NFS SHARES

## Goal

Share some media library or a backup directory on the local network.

## Configuration

### NFS Setup
Check exports:
```bash
showmount -e localhost
```

## Status

The NFS shares are currently not working. This coud be due to the usage of the btrfs filesystem with subvolumes... (?)
